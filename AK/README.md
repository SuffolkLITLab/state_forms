# Things to note

Groups of forms dont have a clear separation in terms of tags, but in the HTML file they are separated by comment sections, so I used author's comments and split function to separate forms by their groups. 
Some forms have comments under them, so for the name of the form I disregard everything following after new line in a line where there is the name of the form.

# Actions taken

1. Separate parts of page by form groups using comment sections provided by the author of the HTML page.
2. Get metadata for each file.
3. Download each form from metadata table.
