# state_forms
code for collecting state court forms

## Purpose
The purpose of these scripts is to collect as many court forms as possible from the above states. When scraping a website, apart from downloading the court forms (usually .pdf or .doc(x) format), we also want to collect some metadata:

1. Jurisdiction (state acronym)
2. Form id (generated by the **`hashme()`** by passing the url of the form as a parameter)
3. Source (the base url)
4. Form title
5. Group in which the form belongs (i.e. Civil, Family, Criminal etc.)
6. Form url
7. Filename (often courts represent forms by using a combination of numerical and alphabetical characters, if this is not the case you can split the form url on the / and get the last element of the resulting array that ends with **.pdf**)
8. Date downloaded (today's date)

**Optional but recommended :** 
1. When downloading files, the **`download`** functions might return an error status. It is highly recommended to save the return value of the function. This will allow you to check whether the operation completed succefully. You can add an additional ***Status*** column in your metadata to indicate whether a form was downloaded or not.
2. When encountering sites with multiple file formats (PDF, doc, docx, zip etc.), it is recommended to add an additional column in your metadata indicating the format of the specific form. 

The metadata file is a CSV created with ***pandas***.
