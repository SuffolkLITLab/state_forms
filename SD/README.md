# Things to note

On the home page of "Unified Judicial System Forms" one may encounter links to the groups or to the form files directly. The form files without specific groups, as they are direct children of the home pagfe, are assigned "Unified Judicial System Forms" groups. The other forms under specific groups are assigned group names of the page they can be found under. 
cm.py file contains a function for creating metadata.

# Actions taken

1. Create metadata for forms that are direct children and a table with groups for those that are not (directories).
2. Process separate groups and add them to metadata.
3. Download each form from metadata table.
