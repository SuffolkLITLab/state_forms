# Things to note

After we find links to each group, we may get the forms associated with this groups right away or we may have another menu of choice (we have that in civil forms, for example). In case of another menu of choice, go through each choice and get the forms from there.

# Actions taken

1. Find the links to each group from the menu, create csv file with group names and their urls.
2. Access each group one ny one. If needed, go through subgroups. Get metadata for each file.
3. Download each form from metadata table.
