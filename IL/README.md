# Things to note

Illinois forms on the main page are divided ny three courts: Circuit, Appelate, Supreme. Within them, we can find the groups of the forms.

# Actions taken

1. Go through each court, extract groups and the links to them. Put groups with associated links in a separate csv file.
2. Parse each group to create metadata for each form.
3. Download each form from metadata table.
