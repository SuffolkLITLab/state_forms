# Things to note

Instead of accessing forms from "All Courts Forms", we want to aim "View forms by Subject" to be able to divide forms by groups. For forms, if we have "Fill-In Form" in style, that means its a .doc form.

# Actions taken

1. Find the links to each groups from the menu, create csv file with group names and their urls.
2. Access each group one ny one, get metadata for each file.
3. Download each form from metadata table.
